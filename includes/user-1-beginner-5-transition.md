## Environments

Defines your application runtime scenarios with regards to

- Security
- Reliability
- Scalability

<em class="yellow">How and where to deploy and run.</em>

<!--- vertical -->

## Creating Environments

- Name: e.g. dev, test, qa, stage, prod
- Admin Status
- DNS
- Availability Mode
- Clouds

Note:
- Demo it
- multiple environments
- multiple clouds per environment

<!--- vertical -->

## Availability Mode

- Single : a single VM for each platform
  - Use for development and initial testing
- Redundant
  - Create highly available services
  - Multiple computes for each platform

<!--- vertical -->

## Clouds

Choose your cloud:

- Capacity 
- Latency
- OS availability

<!--- vertical -->

## Environment Details

- Summary
- Configuration
- Platforms & Components

Note:
- Demo it
- Explain locking of config parameters

<!--- vertical -->

## Deployment

- Pull Design 
  - When changes have been made to the design
- Commit & Deploy
  - Build a deployment plan
  - Review
  - _Deploy_ to actually execute

Note:
- Demo design change and pull into environment
- Demo commit and deploy, show diffs on deployment plan

<!--- vertical -->

## Transition Recap

- Environments map the design to operational requirements
- Multiple environments possible
- Varying availability requirements
- Any cloud provider
- _Commit and Deploy_ to operation
